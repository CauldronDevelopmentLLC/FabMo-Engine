<p>This directory contains the client-side portion of the FabMo system.  The files in the <code>dashboard/static</code> directory make up the dashboard scaffolding that is served to clients connecting to the engine with their browsers.  <code>dashboard/apps</code> contains the built-in apps that come with the engine installation.  App hosting is discussed below. </p>
<h2 id="apps">Apps</h2>
<p>The dashboard apps are hosted from a special location that resides outside the source tree.  (In general, this is <code>/opt/fabmo/approot</code>) The reason for this is because apps are installable by users, and it is important that nothing inside the source tree is ever written, other than during a software update.  When the engine starts, FabMo apps are copied from their source directory (and decompressed as needed) into the hosted directory, where they are served by the engine.</p>
<h2 id="system-apps">System Apps</h2>
<p>There are two sources of apps in FabMo.  <em>System Apps</em> Are apps that come with the engine, and are generally not removable.  <em>User Apps</em> are apps that are installed by users, and can be added and removed at any time.  From the Engine&#39;s perspective, they work the same way.  An app is simply a source of HTML/js/CSS/etc. that is copied to a hosted directory when the engine is launched. (Or when the app is installed at runtime)  The system apps are stored in the <code>apps</code> subdirectory of the dashboard.  They are generally not stored compressed because they are routinely revised, along with the engine source.</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
